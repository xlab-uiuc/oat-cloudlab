"""Profile for running Acto on CloudLab. There is one single physical node. The
OS image is hardwired to Ubuntu 20.04. The hardware type is hardwired to
`c6420`.

Instructions:
Wait for the experiment to start, and then log into the node by either way:

1. (Web-based) clicking on it in the toplogy, and choosing the `shell` menu
option.
2. (Terminal-based) the SSH command you need to login will be provided to you on
the web dashboard, in the form of `ssh <user>@<node>.<cluster>.cloudlab.us`.

Use `sudo` to run root commands.
